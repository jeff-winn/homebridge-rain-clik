# homebridge-veml7700-sensor
HomeBridge connector for the [Adafruit VEML7700 Lux Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4162).

The Adafruit VEML7700 lux sensor does not natively support any API to access the information. As such, the use of this connector does require a separate Raspberry Pi based wireless solution.
